# SARA: SIMA And RAIN Analysis

Demonstrates use of SIMA to analyze a TIFF stack of a confocal microscopy imaging session.

Required files: `sara.py`, `SARA.ipynb`, `original.tif`, and `rgb.png`

Limitations: Currently I only support single-channel imaging.

`serial.py` is an example showing how to run several analysis jobs automatically. It is NOT intended to be used without first understanding it and modifying it to work with your own system.
